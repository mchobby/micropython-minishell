# Mouse support

[NO MOUSE SUPPORT FOR THE MOMENT UNDER PICOTERM]

Mouse scroll wheel 	Move the cursor up and down, scrolling the content as needed.
Mouse left click 	Within the text: Double click starts highlighting at the current position, or clears the highlight. The click speed does not matter. If the cursor is on a word, the whole word will be highlighted. If not, just the character under the cursor. The highlight can then be extended by moving the cursor clicking at different positions.
Mouse right click 	Opens the "find" dialogue in a text file and the "open file" dialogue in a directory listing.
Mouse left click 	In line edit mode: Clicking on a word copies it to the edit line. Clicking a second time at the same place acts as enter.
